<br />

This project is a sleek and modern Pomodoro Timer application designed to help you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The application is built with a focus on simplicity, usability, and modern web development practices.

Inspired by a tutorial from [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/), the initial design is available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/4tCa5znwYHpmT0bYGQp8u1/Pomodoro-Timer).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **React**, **React Router DOM**, and **Context API + Reducer**: React for building UIs, React Router for routing, and Context API with Reducer for state management.
- **TypeScript** and **Zod**: Type-safe JavaScript with TypeScript and schema validation with Zod.
- **Vite** and **ESLint**: Fast build tool (Vite) and code quality tool (ESLint).
- **Styled Components** and **Phosphor Icons**: Styling React components with Styled Components and using Phosphor Icons for flexible icons.
- **React Hook Form** and **immer**: Managing form state with React Hook Form and handling immutable state with immer.
- **date-fns**: Modern date utility library.
- **GitHub Pages** and **localStorage**: Hosting the project on GitHub Pages and storing user data locally using localStorage.

## 🌐 Live Project

The project is integrated with GitHub Pages, ensuring that every commit triggers an automatic deployment. The live version of the application is hosted on GitHub Pages.
